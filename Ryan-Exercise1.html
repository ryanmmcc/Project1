        <h3>Intrests</h3>
        <p>Many of my interests and hobbies overlap with each other. My main hobby is skateboarding, I started late in my junior year of high school and I haven’t stopped since. It’s become such a large part of my life and has stood the test of time when compared to all of my other past hobbies and I don’t see myself stopping any time soon. I’ve gotten a lot of opportunities, like getting a brief sponsorship my freshman year of college, and met so many great people through it.
            Another one of my favorite hobbies is photography and videography. I have been into videography since my senior year of high school. One of my friends showed me how to film some tricks for him and I have been filming a lot of skateboarding since then, even having my own camera rig setup. This leads to another one of my hobbies, photography, that I got into just within the past year. Around early September of last year I started going to see local bands perform and began to take some photos of them. As a result, I got closer to the bands and have become good friends with almost all of them. I had begun shooting with my iPhone and GoPro, and some of my friends who have actual DSLR cameras took notice of the good photos that I was taking. Hearing that I was taking good photos with just my phone from people with actual cameras definitely made me more confident. Over the next few months, everyone was telling me that I should get an actual camera. So, over the summer I worked a lot and saved up enough to get one so I would have it when I got back to school. I’m beyond stoked to be back and start taking photos at shows again.</p>
